# Optimal binary representation via non-convex optimization on tomograhpic displays

This repository provides source code and rendered light fields (~500MB) used for the non-convex optimization work on tomographic displays, from OEQELAB at Seoul National University.

All codes are implemented with MATLAB R2018a (but maybe compatible with other versions).

Feel free to use our contents and code in your own projects, but please acknowledge our work by citing the following papers:
